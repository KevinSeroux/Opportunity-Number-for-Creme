Opportunity Number for Crème is a module for Crème CRM 1.4.
http://www.cremecrm.com/

It enables to replace the "reference" field when you view, create or edit the opportunities by an auto-increment unique integer field whose value can be user-chosen.


REMARK AND CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT:

The fact to solve the need to have an auto-incremented positive number field for some companies by creating a python-coded module is very not user-friendly. It requires a developer and it should be able to do by a non-programmer administrator.

=> So the solution is to develop a feature to graphically-enable it <=

Graphically, the possibility to change the fields order when you create or edit an opportunity and set some properties such as auto-increment is not available yet.


INSTALL:

1. You have to move the opportunity_number folder into the creme folder which contains all the others modules such as activesync, activites, ...

2 - Add the module 'creme.opportunity_number' into the INSTALLED_CREME_APPS tuple in your settings file (local_setting.py).

Now, let's create the migration file.

3 - If you already have rows in your opportunities_opportunity table you must allow duplicated values in opportunity_number/models/opportunity.py line 10. Think to reset to True at the end of the data migration. You should get
    opportunity_number = PositiveIntegerField(_("Opportunity number"), unique=False)


4. Run the command : "python2.7 manage.py schemamigration opportunities --auto" and you'll get:

   ? The field 'Opportunity.opportunity_number' does not have a default specified, yet is NOT NULL.
   ? Since you are adding this field, you MUST specify a default
   ? value to use for existing rows. Would you like to:
   ?  1. Quit now, and add a default to the field in models.py
   ?  2. Specify a one-off value to use for existing columns now
   ? Please select a choice:

5 - Select the second option and write the default value to write for all the rows (not important if your table is empty).

Our migration file is now created.

6 - If you're also installing Crème, refer you to https://bitbucket.org/hybird/creme_crm-1.4/overview
    If you just want to migrate data, run "python2.7 manage.py migrate opportunities"

7 - If you are in the situation explained in the step 3 (data migrations), correct all the opportunity number with any software you want. The opportunity numbers must not be duplicated otherwise the next step will not works. Then reset unique=True for the field.

8 - The module is ready, you can now launch Crème.


APPEARANCE:

The module opportunities provide 4 views to:
1 - Display the portal of the opportunities
2 - Display the list of the opportunities
3 - Display the details of an opportunity
4 - Create or edit an opportunity

By default, the reference field is always displayed on the detail view. The portal, the list and the view to create or edit (thanks to the place_opportunity_number_field function in opportunity_number/forms/opportunity.py) doesn't. So I recommend you to create your own custom block (with the Crème interface), remove the reference field and place the opportunity number just after the opportunity name. Then edit the opportunity block in Types of configured ressources (not sure about the translation) and replace amoung the blocks to display at left, the informations about the opportunity by your custom blocks.

TROUBLESHOOTINGS:

- If when you try to create create the migration file, you get this following error "ValueError: South does not support on_delete with SET(function) as values.". Comment the line 70 in creme_core/models/fields.py JUST for the creation. And try again. You must restore it after that. This problem is known for the Creme developers. See (in french sorry) :
